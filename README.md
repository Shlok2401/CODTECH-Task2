Objective:

The main objective of the BMI Tracker webpage is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The webpage will offer a straightforward interface for inputting these values and will display the calculated BMI along with a classification of the BMI range (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).

Key Activities:

1)Requirement Analysis

Identify user requirements and specifications for the BMI tracker.
Define the input fields (height and weight) and output (BMI and classification).

2)Design

Create wireframes and mockups of the webpage.
Design a user-friendly interface for inputting data and displaying results.

3)Development

Set up the project environment and tools.
Implement the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Develop the BMI calculation logic.
Ensure responsive design for various devices (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).

4)Testing

Conduct unit testing for the BMI calculation logic.
Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the webpage meets user requirements.
Test the webpage across different browsers and devices for compatibility.

5)Deployment

Host the webpage on a web server or platform.
Set up a domain and ensure the webpage is accessible online.

6)Maintenance

Monitor the webpage for any issues or bugs.
Update the webpage as needed based on user feedback and new requirements.
